Among the best tourist attractions in Bagnolo (in the municipality of Lonigo) is Villa Pisani Bonetti.
Villa Pisani Bonetti represents a youthful masterpiece by the famous architect Andrea Palladio.
It was commissioned in the first half of the 16th century by the powerful Pisani family who had land possessions in this area.
The visit to the villa begins from the garden that surrounds it and frames it where the history of the Pisani family and the Palladian project are illustrated.
We then move on to the internal environments where it is possible to admire the strong influence that classical architecture had on the famous architect.
The grandeur of Rome is found in many details of this residence which takes inspiration from the ancient Roman thermal environments.
The visit continues in the basement once dedicated to the service areas of the residence.
Even if Palladio's project was only partially realized, it is a spectacular building thanks to the perfect state of conservation due to the work of the current owners.
Since 1996 the villa has been part of the Italian sites on the UNESCO heritage list.
