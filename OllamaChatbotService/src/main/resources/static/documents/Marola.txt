Marola is a Municipality of Torri di Quartesolo, in Vicenza, that has recently opened a new beach at its lake.
An area surrounded by green trees, adjacent to the Marola lake, in the municipality of Torri di Quartesolo, for those who want to spend a few hours away from the heat of the city in a relaxed environment.
The park offers over 5000 meters of greenery in a relaxing and pleasant environment where you can spend time away from the heat of the city's summer heat. A choice of dishes typically linked to "street food" will be present throughout the summer with burritos, burgers, a wide selection of beers and drinks, to guarantee a complete offer from aperitif until late at night. And the music selection? It will be curated by a line up of local DJs, varying from evening to evening.
Two mini restaurants, a craft brewery and cocktail bar, for outdoor activities: two newly built beach volleyball courts ready to host tournaments and games between friends, and a station for playing Teqball, a new sport practiced on a curved Ping-Pong table that offers professional footballers and enthusiasts an excellent tool to develop and improve their techniques and concentration skills.
